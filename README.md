# open-fpga-install
Installer for the open fpga toolset for Lattice processors. This tool has been created so that it can be translated to any languages.

# compatibility
This installer has been made for Ubuntu/Debian computers, there is no doubt it should also work on other \*NIX systems, but you might have to change some of the commands.

# usage
* open a CLI (command line interface)
* clone the repository with: 'git clone https://github.com/dcuartielles/open-fpga-install.git'
* enter the directory where things got cloned: 'cd open-fpga-install'
* execute the installer as sudo: 'sudo bash install.sh'

The full installation process takes quite some time, you can shorten it down if you have some of the parts already installed in your computer. The installer will be prompting you about each one of the blocks to be installed.

# description
This is a complex installer that allows internationalization.

The goal behind it is allowing as many people as possible getting access to this knowledge by giving them the chance to read what is being done in their computers in their own language.

# contribute!
Please contribute translating the \*.po files to as many languages as possible.

I accept pull-requests in exchange for good old school open source credit :-)

# credit
Besides all of the good work made by the open-fpga community, there are the following people to thank for their specific direct contribution to this project:

* Louis Iacona: for his great example on how to make a multiligual installation script, or multilingual anything CLI for that matter
* J. Gonzalez (a.k.a. Obijuan) that besides making the tutorials for ICEStick, submitted the first pull request to this project on the installation order of the different packages
